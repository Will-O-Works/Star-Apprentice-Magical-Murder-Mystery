This game is being made for a student project for CMPUT250 Fall 2020 at the University of Alberta.

Star Apprentice: Magical Murder Mystery is a danmaku-detective game that combines the point-and-click style deduction gameplay of Phoenix Wright with the high octane bullet hell gameplay of the Touhou Project franchise.
